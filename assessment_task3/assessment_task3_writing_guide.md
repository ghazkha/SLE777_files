# SLE712 Assignment 3

Due date: Friday 28th May (week 11)

This assignment consists of two bioinformatics exercises.
You may work individually or in groups of two or three, so long as there is evidence of contribution to the code repository by all members.
Your submission will consist of a written report AND one GitHub repository.
The report will be submitted as one PDF document to the CloudDeakin dropbox.
Submitting in a different format will result in a 5% deduction.
There is a maximum word count of 1000 words. 
The report should include a cover sheet with names, student numbers, unit code, date of submission and assignment title
If you describe ideas and works that are not your own, you must reference your sources with in-text citations and a list of references according to the Harvard style: https://www.deakin.edu.au/students/studying/study-support/referencing/harvard 
Any further questions please contact me by discussion board or email: m.ziemann{at}deakin.edu.au 
This assignment is worth 20% of your total grade for the unit. A breakdown of the marks is provided:

## Rubric


Criteria | Full mark | Half mark | No mark
-- | -- | -- | --
Code works | The code provided on Github executes without errors and generates the correct answer | The code provided on GitHub has a slight mistake which gives an incorrect answer but there is evidence that student has used the learning materials and made an attempt | The code yields an error or there is a major mistake, or no GitHub repository was provide
Code Documentation | The repository has a detailed README that accurately describes the contents. The code contains enough comments to describe what each chunk of code is doing | There is a README and some comments but they are not detailed enough or contain inaccurate information | There was no attempt to document the repository
Evidence of team coding | All group members made numerous contributions including code, issues and documentation versioning | Each member made one contribution to the repository | Only one commit was made, or no repo was provided
Written answers | Written answers provided in  the submitted report address the question accurately and is consistent with code provided. Student provided a clear description of how the problem was solved. | The question was answered accurately but the method used to solve the problem was not given. Minor inconsistencies between answer and code. Minor grammar or spelling errors. | Student response did not answer the question or there are major inconsistencies between code and answer. Major grammatical and spelling errors.
